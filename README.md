Spark Core and SmartThings
--------------------------

This is a sample application using [Spark Core][1] and [SmartThings][2]. 

The Spark Core application uses DHT22 Sensor for Temperature and Humidity value and defines two Spark.function to read these sensor values.

The SmartThings application defines a new Device Type and uses Spark Core APIs to read the sensor values. The device type specifies the "Polling" capability but only sometimes it is working (Raised the issue and I am awaiting SmartThings reply on this)

**Wiring**

 1. DHT 3.3v to 3.3v 
 2. HT GND to GND 
 3. HT SIG to D4

**Installation**

1. Create a new device type (https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/devices) with Name: Spark Core Temperature Sensor, Author: Krishnaraj Varma, Capabilities: Polling Relative Humidity Measurement Sensor Temperature Measurement

2. Create a new device (https://graph.api.smartthings.com/device/list) with Name: 
   Your Choice, Device Network Id:
   Your Choicem Type: Spark Core Temperature Sensor (should be the last option), Location: Choose the correct location, Hub/Group: Leave blank

3. Update device preferences, Click on the new device to see the details. 
   Click the edit button next to Preferences and Enter the Device ID and Access Token

4. Open the Mobile Application and add the newly created device, click refresh to see the Temperature and Humidity values
